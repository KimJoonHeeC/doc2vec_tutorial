그럼 제가 나중에 연락드릴게요

기다릴게요


방금 번호 땄지롱

한번 보시라
홀리!(holly)

죽이는데, 이름이 ly로 
끝나는 여자들은 언제나 끝내주지(dirty)

홀리, 켈리, 칼리, 릴리까지

그만해


하긴, 그렇긴 해

i로 끝나는 여자들 이름 
얘기는 꺼내지도 마라

걔네들은 꼭 
롤러코스터같다니까

한참을 기다리다가 타지만 
타고나면 살려달라고 빌게된다니까

난 지금 홀리한테 전화할거야

전화해서 "오랜만이네요~" 라고 
말하면 웃기겠지


방금 만난 여자니까 웃기잖아

전화하면 안돼

3일은 진득히 
기다렸다 전화하는거야

그게 규칙이라고

그 규칙은 한물갔어
여자들도 다 안다고

난 나만의 규칙이 있어
"맘에 들면 전화해라"

뭐라고? 다시말해봐
섹스하기 싫다는 말로 들리는데

3일규칙은 미친 짓이야
누가 만들어낸건데?


예수님이


야, 예수님은 엮지마라

정말이야

예수님이 3일규칙을 만든거라니까

부활하시기 전까지 3일을 
기다리셨던거 모르냐

완벽한 설정이었지

하루만에 부활했으면
죽은지도 몰랐을걸

다들 "예수님~ 안녕하신가요" 라고 
인사했겠지

그럼 예수님은 이런 반응이었겠지
"안녕하냐고? 나 어제 죽었었다"

그럼 사람들이 
"좋아보이시는데요"라고 하면

예수님이 구차하게 얼마나 
대단한 부활이었는지 설명해야하잖아

그랬으면 사람들은 
"뭐라는거야, 어쨋든 잘됐네요"라고 하겠지

대화체로 얘기하니까 
쏙쏙 들어오는데?

만약에 토요일인 
둘째날에 부활했어봐

다들 집안일하랴 수염다듬으랴 
바쁜데 그럼 못쓰지

예수님은 기다림의 미학을 아신거라고

정확히 3일이지

알았어, 3일있다 
전화할테니까 좀 닥쳐라

하지만 일요일이었지!
모두 교회에 모여있었어

사람들은 예수가 
죽었다며 슬퍼했지만, 그 순간!

예수님이 문을 박차고 들어오신거야

손을 흔들며 복도를 뛰어들어오셨지

바로 그때 하이파이브가 생긴거라고

3일이다

정확히 3일을 기다려야돼

그게 예수님의 말씀이야


모두 사실이야


영자막없이 만든 자막입니다
수정불가합니다

알았어, 약속할게
절대 홀리한테 전화안해

하지만 문자는 할 수 있었지

난 나름 귀엽다고 
생각했던 문자를 보냈단다

당신 생각이 나서 
문자한번 보내봐염ㅎㅎ

하지만 발송버튼을 누른 순간 
전혀 귀엽지 않다는걸 알게됐지

문자 중 가히 최악이었단다

하지만 문자는 한번 보내면


절대 주워담을 수 없지

기다리는 수밖에 없는거야
 23분 후

다신 문자를 보내지 
않겠다고 생각하는 순간


저도 당신 생각하고 있었어요
근데 어쩜 제가 목욕 중이네요?


뭐야?

- 뭐가?
- 무슨 소리 들었는데

아, 핸드폰
문자알람소리야

그거말고
발가벗은 여자 웃음소리말이야

뭐?

발가벗은 여자들 볼 때마다 
이렇게 웃잖아


- 아니거든?
- 뻥치시네


미안해, 릴리!


남자들이 사냥하는 동안
여자들은 강가에서 빨래를 합니다


저건 분명히 가슴이다


문자보내는 사람이 홀리야?
3일 기다리기로 했잖아

문자는 괜찮잖아

알았으니까 그렇게 웃지 좀 말래?

난 그런거 모른다니까?


정말?


나와 홀리는 
새벽 2시까지 문자질을 했단다

다음날에도 하루종일 
문자를 주고받았지

정말 완벽한 여자같았어


홀리가 문자로 지금 
뭘입고 있는지 보냈어

꽤 섹시한데

그게 뭐든지간에
다 거짓말일걸

자길 좋아하게 만드려는거야

니가 어떻게 알아?


왜냐면 치어리더 옷을 입고
건축잡지를 읽는 여자는 없으니까

그래, 뭐
건축잡지는 거짓말일지도


뭐야, 이건
이럴 순 없어

뭔데?

문자가 잘못온거같아


"오빠, 지네로에서 먹을거 
사가지고 빨리와"

그래, 뭐
남자친구일수도 있지만

잘 생각해봐
친오빠일 수도 있고

아빠라고 쓰려던거 아닐까

끝까지 읽어봐


"쇼파에서 해줘"

아빠는 확실히 아니네
아빠일수도 있으려나?


미안해


안녕, 얘들아

왔어?


이건 뭐야?


지네로에서 릴리 
줄 음식 좀 샀어

이상하네, 좀전에 홀리가 테드랑 
문자보내면서 지네로 얘기했었거든

잠깐

이 노무 쉐키들!

뭐?


니가 홀리잖아!


그럼 테드는 홀리가 아니라
너네랑 문자한거야?

테드가 3일전에 연락할 줄 알았어
그래서 핸드폰을 바꿔치기해서

장난 좀 친거야

테드가 3일안에 전화하면
놀려주려고 했는데

문자를 보내잖아


문자한번 보내봐염ㅎㅎ?

불쌍한 테드
그냥 얼른 말해주자

그래, 아니면

우리가 목욕하고 있는 
홀리인척 하는거야

그게 더 재밌겠다


이럴 줄 알았다니까
이제 얘기해주자

그래, 그래야지
아니면

가장 좋아하는 색이 빨강색이고 
카우보이 옷이 섹시하다고 하는거야

좋은 생각인데

 저도 카우보이 옷 입고 있어요
섹시하겠죠?


- 얘 부츠 신고 있다!
- 분명히 신고 있어!

진짜 웃긴다
인제 얘기해주자

그래, 아니면

- 지금 막 옷 벗었다고 보내봐
- 그래

검정색 레이스 브라 
입고있다고 할까?

난 벗은게 좋던데

당장 그걸로 해


얘 인제 부츠만 신고 다 벗었어!
죽인다!

완전 죽여!

인제 손을 천천히 밑으로...


우리 지금 뭐해?


우리..지금...

테드랑 섹스하기 직전인거같아


그래서 하루종일 테드 놀린거야?

- 진짜 못됐다
- 아냐, 아냐

다 테드를 위한거야
테드를 보호하기 위한거라고

테드 눈보면 알잖아
그 미친눈

그래, "나 너무 좋아서 미쳐버릴 것 같아"라고 
말하는 눈

네가 테드랑 
첫 데이트할 때랑 똑같은 눈이야

어땠는지 기억나지?


- 사랑에 빠진 것 같아요
- 네?

그건 내가 특별한 케이스였고
그 여자는 내가 아니잖아

머리는 또 어떻고?

테드가 연애한지가 좀 되서

분명히 미쳐버릴거라고
진짜 여자를 만나기전에 해결해야해

설명해줄 수도 있어
테드가 미치기 전 징후들이 있지

1. 결혼에 관한 농담을 한다

건축가가 좋으시다구요?
그럼 우리 결혼해야겠네요! 하하

ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 장난이에요
거기에 물음표까지 찍었어

2. 같이 여행가자고 제의한다

저도 맥주좋아해요
우리 독일여행가요!

ㅋㅋㅋㅋ장난이에요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

3. 너무 쉽게 사생활을 얘기한다

몇년전에 부모님이 이혼하셨어요
정말 힘든 시간이었죠..ㅋㅋ

거기에 왜 ㅋㅋ을 붙이는거지?

마지막으로 걔는 
사랑한다는 말을 너무 쉽게 한단말이야

그러다가 스탠을 만났지


거참, 조용히 좀 합시다!


그래서 우리 얘기를 해줬는데
정말 멋진 이야기를 들었지

그냥 테드한테 자기를 신경쓰고 
사랑하고 있는 사람이 있다는걸

알려주는게 어때?
과거는 다 잊고 나아가는거야

희망을 품게 하는거지

멋진데?
그 남자 누구야?

- 경비원이래, 밤에 일해
- 여기서 매일 점심을 먹어

- 아직 안끝났어
- 더 들어봐

나의 모든 삶이 당신을 만나기
위한 신의 계시였군요


정말 멋지네요

좀 괜찮네


우리가 만나면 
절 꼭 안아주세요

밤새 안아줘요
머리를 쓰다듬고

제가 당신거라고
당신이 제 남자라고 말해줘요

지금만큼은 저와 당신뿐이에요

좋아요!!


아, 이걸 문자로 보내라는거죠
저도 알고 있어요


설명은 필요없어요
전 기다릴거에요

저와 당신, 빵, 빛 그리고 
그림자가 함께하는 밤을


빵이 거기 왜 들어갔는지 모르지만 
어쨋든 감동적이에요

여기랑 여기가 아주...

테드가 말하지 않는다면
제가 해드릴게요

사랑해요


좋았어


아직 답이 없어?

테드한테는 별론가봐요

어떻게 별로일 수가 있어?
테드의 이상형인데!

저도 잘 모르겠네요


난 이만 가볼게

또..또 만날 수 있나요?

바람과 믿음, 기회가 이끌면 
또 만나겠지, 내일 봅시다

치즈스테이크 먹는 날이거든


니들 완전 홀딱 빠졌구나

스탠 여자친구가 질투하겠다

여자친구 얘긴안했지?

마샬이 테드한테 보낼 문자를 
릴리한테 보내지만 않았어도

완벽했을텐데

어쨋든 이제 그만해

난 지금 가야되니까
니들이 전화해서 사과해, 알았지?

응


아니면...

홀리가 다 설명해줬어
다 오해였던거 있지

정말?
홀리가 뭐라는데?

마샤라는 친구가 
핸드폰을 빌려썼는데

남편한테 보낼 문자를 
나한테 보낸거래

마샤라...


그래서 지금은 다 풀었어

좀 미친 소리로 들리겠지만

나 홀리를 정말 사랑하는 것 같아

마샬이랑 바니를 사랑하는거겠지

뭐?


니가 3일씩 못기다릴거라면서
걔들이 너한테 장난친거야

홀리가 바니랑 마샬이야

그럼 홀리가 아니었단 말이야?


목욕했던 것도 홀리가 아니고


창가에 앉아 별을 보며 
날 생각한 것도?


치어리더 옷을 입고 
건축잡지를 본건?


응, 그걸 진짜 한건 아니고 
그냥 바에서 문자보낸거겠지

- 응, 그래
- 어쨋든 걔네 짓이야

- 미친거 아냐?
- 그러게

이제 니가 알게됐다고 전화해봐

그래, 아니면...


나도 장난으로 문자보내볼까?

좋은 생각인데?
이건 어때?

아직 누구에게도 말하지 않았지만
살날이 3개월밖에 안남았다고 할까?

괜찮은데


난 3개월짜리가 좋은 것 같은데

아무한테도 말안했지만
베프의 엄마랑 잔 적있다고 하는건 어때?

그거 재밌겠다

근데 난 3개월이 더 좋다고!

- 완벽한게 생각났어
- 정말?


답장왔다!!


이런 얘긴하면 안되겠지만...
우린 만난지 얼마 안됐잖아요

하지만...뭐..어때요?
그냥 말할게요

드디어 사랑해,라고 말하나봐!

스탠이 여기 있었어야하는데

아...스탠...

뭐야?

가끔씩 제 베프가 
등장하는 동성애 꿈을 꿔요


가끔씩 제 베프가 
등장하는 동성애 꿈을 꿔요?

왜 테드가 잘 알지도 
못하는 여자한테 나에 관한

동성애꿈을 꾼단 소릴 했을까?

야, 누가 너래?

너라고?
당연히 이건 나지

내가 베프잖아!
당연히 나지

테드가 너보고 베프라고 하디?

그리고 우리 둘 중 한명이 게이 꿈에 
나온다면 그건 당연히 나라고

날 좀 봐라

넌 거울 좀 보고

게이 할아버지라면 또 모를까


잘 들어, 바니

난 푸근한 스타일이잖아
넌 아니거든

섹스하고 난 일요일 비오는 아침에 
오븐에서 나는 고소한 빵냄새를 맡으며

품에 안겨서 편하게 쉴 수 있지
내가 짱이거든! 인정해!

그래도 분명한건 테드는 
날씬한 사람을 좋아한다는거야

내 몸에 완전 뿅간거야

나랑 테드는 오랜 친구였다고
테드가 뭘 좋아하는진 내가 더 잘알아

내가 잠자리에서 테드를...


- 테드랑 섹스하는 얘기는 그만하자
- 엉, 토나와

이건 말도 안돼

테드가 나에 관한 동성애 꿈을 꾼다고?

꿈에선 분명히 이 몸
마샬 에릭슨이 주인공일거야

그래서 어쩌라고?
테드가 그런 꿈을 꾼다고 해도

테드가 살날이 3개월밖에 
안남았다는 것보다 충격적이야?

이게 더 충격적이지?

테드가 왔네?
내 12년지기 베프

좀 이상하긴한데
몇일전 특이한 꿈을 꿨어

좀 민망하긴 한데...

다 털어버려,테드
우린 믿어도 돼

그래, 그건 아주 자연스러운거야

그래, 말할게

난 30분동안 지겹도록 내가 
가장 좋아하는 역사상 위대한 건축가

5인에 대해 설명하기 시작했단다

식사가 거의 끝나갈 쯤에 
프랭크 게리가 아이엠 페이에게
(I.M.Pei-중국 건축가)

계산서를 내밀면서 이렇게 말했어 
"오늘밤 자네 이름은 아이엠페잉,이네"
(I'm paying - 내가 내겠소)

완전 배꼽빠지게 웃기지않냐

그리고 잠에서 깼어


그게 다야?

다른 꿈은 없고?
혼란스럽거나 야한거?

없는데


내 말 들어봐


- 미래엔 로봇들이 인간을 지배할 수도 있잖아
- 그럼

그리고 로봇들이 다른 사람은 다 죽이고 
너와 나, 그리고 바니만 남은거야

그리고 우리 둘중에 하나만 골라서 
해야한다면..누굴 고를꺼야?


왜 내가 니들이랑 그래야되는데?

로봇들이 그런걸 보고싶어해서 
억지로 시키는거야

어려운 질문인데
아마도...


홀리겠지!

로빈이 다 얘기해줘서
니들한테 거짓말한거야!

- 이쪽은 홀리야
- 안녕하세요

홀리한테는 3일규칙 따위는 
상관없을 것 같아서 일찍 연락했지

제가 너무 일찍 연락했나요?

아뇨, 전 좋던데요
아주 로맨틱했어요

참고로, 전 치어리더 옷입고 
건축잡치 안읽어요


잡지읽을땐 주로 다 벗죠


- 우린 저녁먹으러 나가볼게
- 입구에서 만나요/네

미안해
널 도와주려다 그런거야

근데 너무 재밌었단 말이지


니들 도움은 필요없어
내가 알아서 할게


그래, 어떤 여자들이 일찍 
연락하는걸 싫어한다치자

그럼 그 여자들은 내 사람이 아닌가보지

내 여자는 아마 
내가 언제 연락하든 상관없을거야

왜냐면...그게 나니까

난 그딴 3일규칙같은 것때문에 
날 바꾸진 않을거야


참, 홀리이름은 i로 끝나더라


아빠는 이렇게 3일규칙이 
틀렸다는걸 증명했단다

그리고 예쁜 여자와 저녁을 먹었지

하지만 오늘날까지 누구에게도 그날 
저녁 무슨일이 있었는지 말하지않았단다

정말 웃기네요, 저도 뮤지컬 애니 좋아해요
우리 결혼해야할까봐요

하하, 장난이에요

정말 해야되나?
하하, 장난이에요

우리 브라질 같이 여행가요!

오늘 병원갔었는데 전 멀쩡하데요
여행가도 좋아요!

당신을 사랑하는거 같아요
테드

3일규칙은 쓸모없지만
홀리에게는 그 규칙이 필요한 것 같았단다

규칙에는 그것을 따라야 할 때와 
말아야 할때가 있지

하지만 이건 확실하단다

내가 너희 엄마 번호를 땄을 땐

바로 전화했었지


- 스탠이다!
- 안녕

- 오늘 일안해요?
- 오늘은 쉬어

잘됐다! 다같이 놀 수 있겠어요

안돼, 할 일이 있어서
갈까, 자기야?

응


- 그냥 같이 놀면 안될까?
- 응, 재밌을거야

벌써 난 웃고있잖아

재밌을거야
마술좋아해요?

자네들
이제 헤어져야할 시간이네

지난 오후에는 정말 즐거웠다네
절대 자네들을 잊지않을거야


- 쟤네이름 알아?
- 몰라, 키 큰애가 바니야?

아니, 걔는 마샬이야

- 자기,치킨윙 좋아해?
- 당연하지



Great. So,um,I'll give you a call.


- I hope you do.
- All right.


Look at this.


I just got that girl's
number. Check it out.


Holly. Nice.


Girls whose names end
in L-Y are always dirty.


Holly,Kelly,Carly,Lily.


Oh,yeah,I know it's true.


And don't even get me started on
girlshose names should end in Y,


but instead end in I.


Those girls are like roller coasters.


You got to wait in a long
line,but once you get up there,


you just hold on for dear life
and hope you don't drop your keys.


Hey,you know what I'm gonna do?


I'm gonna call her right now.


I'm gonna do that whole,"Hey,remember
me? It's been so long."


See,it's funny because I just saw her.


Dude,you can't call her.


You have to wait three days to
call a woman. That's the rule.


Barney,that rule is
completely played out.


Girls know exactly what you're doing.


Hey,I got a new rule.


It's kind of crazy,but I call
it,You like her,you call her.


I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
I don't speak I Never Get Laid.


Barney,the Three Days Rule is insane.


I mean,who even came up with that?


Jesus.


Barney,don't do this. Not with Jesus.


Seriously. Jesus started the
whole wait-three-days thing.


He waited three days
to come back to life.


It was perfect.


If he have only waited one day,a lot of
people wouldn't have even heard that he died.


They'd be all,"Hey,Jesus,what up?"


And Jesus would probably
be,like,"What up? I died yesterday."


And then they'd be all,Uh,you
look pretty alive to me,dude.


And then Jesus would have to explain how
he was resurrected and how it was a miracle.


And then,the dude would
be,like,Uh,okay,whatever you say,bro.


Wow,ancient dialogue
sounds so stilted now.


And he's not going to
come back on a Saturday.


Everybody's busy doing chores.


Working the loom,trimming
their beards. No.


He waits the exact right
number of days... Three.


Okay,I promise-- I'll wait three
days. Just please stop talking.


Plus,it's Sunday,so
everyone's in church already.


They're all in
there,Oh,no,Jesus is dead.


Then,bam! He bursts through
the back door,runs up the aisle.


Everyone's totally psyched.


And,FYI,that's when he
invented the high-five.


Three days,Ted.


We wait three days to call a woman because
that's how long Jesus wants us to wait.

How I Met Your
Mother Season04 Episode21


Okay,fine. I promise,I won't
call Holly for three days.


But I never said anything about texting.


I started things off with
something cute and charming.


"I was thinking about you,so I thought
I'd send you a little texty text."


And the moment I hit "Send," I
realized it wasn't cute at all.

{\a6}texty text

It was the lamest thing
anyone has ever said to anyone.


And the worst thing about texting
is that once you send it...


Oh,no! No!


you can never get it back.


And then... you wait.

{\a6}******

And just when you've decided
never to text anyone again...


"I've been thinking about you,too,


"and how weird is it that you
texted me while I was in the bath?"


- What was that?
- What?


- You made a noise.
- That was my phone. I got a text.


- Not that. You made your naked lady noise.
- What?


Whenever you see a naked
lady,you make the noise.


I don't do that.


Really?


Oh,God,sorry,Lily.


While the men are out hunting,the women
of New Guinea's indigenous Korowai tribe


wash their clothes in the river.


That's totally a boob.


Is that Holly who keeps texting you?


Didn't you promise to wait three days?


To call,yes. Texting
is totally different.


Okay,well,just try to keep the
naked lady noises to a minimum.


I don't make a naked lady noise.


Really?


Holly and I stayed up texting
until 2:00 in the morning.


And we spent the whole next
day texting each other,too.


She seemed perfect.


Holly just told me what
she's wearing right now.


It is pretty hot.


Yeah,whatever it is,I can
guarantee you she's not wearing it.


She's lying to you to make you like her.


- How do you know that?
- Here. Come here.


Because no woman in the
history of the world is ever


"just sitting around reading architecture
magazines in my old cheerleader uniform."


Okay,maybe she's lying about
the architecture magazines.


Oh,no.


- Oh,no. This is bad.
- What?


She just sent me a text that was
clearly meant for someone else.


"Hey,baby,I picked up some take-out
from Generro's. Be home soon."


Okay,yes,this sounds bad,but
let's think about this,okay?


It could be for a brother
or maybe her sick dad.


Scroll down.


"And then I want you
to do me on the couch."


Okay,maybe not a sick dad.


Or a very sick dad. Am I right?


Sorry.


Hey,guys.


God. What is this?


It's just some take-out from Generro's.
I'm bringing it home for Lily.


Oh,that's weird.


Holly just texted Ted something
about take-out from Generro's.


Wait a second.


- You sons of bitches.
- What?


You're Holly.


So Ted hasn't been texting Holly at all?


He's been texting you two?


Look,we knew he'd try to call her before
the three days,so I swiped his phone,


and I changed her
number to my work cell.


We were just gonna bust on him for calling
her too soon,but then he started texting her.


Texty text?


Oh,Ted.


Oh,poor,sweet Ted. We should...
we should tell him it's us.


Yeah. Or...


we pretend we're Holly,and
we're in the bath.


Yeah,that's better.


Well,that was fun.


We should tell him that it's us.


Yeah,we should. Or...


we tell him our favorite color is red,and
we think the cowboy look is very sexy.


Yeah,that's better.


I'm wearing them right
now,and they do look sexy.


- He put on the boots!
- He totally put on the boots!


- That was awesome!
- Yeah.


But it's time to tell him who
he really put those boots on for.


Yeah. Or...


we just took off our shirt.


Yeah,that's better.


You think maybe we're wearing
a black lace bra underneath?


I don't think we're
wearing anything underneath.


God,we're hot.


Now he's only wearing the
cowboy boots! It is on!


It is so on! Okay,okay,tell
him that we're...


we're slowing slipping out of our...


What are we doing?


I think that we're about
to have sex with Ted.


So,you did this to him
all day? That's just mean.


No,no. No,it was... It was
actually for his own good.


We're protecting him from himself.


He... No. He really likes this girl.


He had that-that look in his eye.


Yeah,that crazy "I'm about to move
too fast and screw this up" look.


It was actually the same look he
had on his first date with you.


- And we all remember how that went.
- Yeah.


- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?


Yeah,well,I-I think
I was a special case.


This Holly is no Robin Scherbatsky.


Hey,what is the deal with her hair?


I mean,news flash: they make
conditioners that don't leave a buildup.


I'm so b.


Look,it's been a while since
Ted really liked someone.


He's clearly got a lot of
crazy stored up. We just...


we thought we'd get him to say "I love you"
before he even makes contact with this girl.


And you can tell it's on the way.
He's exhibiting all the telltale signs.


Yeah. One: He joked
about getting married.


"You like architecture? We
should get married." "Ha-ha.LOL."


"Just kidding. Question mark?"


Two: He made a crazy
way-too-soon trip suggestion.


"I like beer,too. We should
totally go to Germany together."


"LOL.JK.LOL."


And three: He got way
too personal way too soon.


"Yeah,my parents got
divorced a couple years back.


It was really tough." LOL."


And he clearly doesn't
know what LOL means.


Yeah,but here's the real problem.


Ted wasn't saying "I love you"
as easily as we thought he would.


Then we met... Stan.


Why are you making so much noise,man?


So we explained everything to him,and when
we were done,something amazing happened.


Why don't you tell Ted that just knowing
he's out there,thinking about you,


caring about you,makes you feel safe?


So,all your fears,all
your yesterdays wash away,


and only hope remains in
the promise of his embrace.


Go,Stan. Who is this guy?


He's a security guard who works nights.


And he eats lunch at
MacLaren's every day.


- And he wasn't done.
- Not by a long shot.


You make me thank God for
every mistake I ever made


because each one led me down
the path that brought me to you.


That's,uh,really nice,man.


Whatever. It's okay.


"And when finally come
together,"I want you to hold me.


Hold me" "all night. Stroke my hair."


"Tell me I'm a woman
and show me you're a man.


Until there there was only now."


You and I... and now."


Yes!


You want me to text
that to Ted. I know that.


"I do not ask "of the
night explanations.


I wait for it,and it envelops me,"


"and so you and bread
and light and shadow are."


That's Pablo Neruda.


I don't know,um,what
bread was doing in there,


but that touched me here and here.


Well,if Ted won't say it,I will.


I love you.


That's cool.


Still nothing,huh?


Maybe he's not in love with us.


How can he not be in love with us?
We're everything he's looking for.


I don't get men.


Got to head to work.


Will you be... Will you be back?


I'll be back when the wind and
fates and chance bring me back.


Which will be tomorrow.


It's cheese steak day.


It sounds like you
were all over this guy.


Hope his girlfriend didn't get jealous.


Did he mention a girlfriend or...


It was all going great until Marshall sent Ted
a text meant for Lily and ruined everything.


Well,it doesn't matter.
Okay? It's over now.


I got to get going,but
here's what's going to happen:


You're going to call him right
now,tell him what you did,and apologize.


- You got it?
- Yes.


Or...


Holly explained everything. It
was all just a misunderstanding.


- Everything's great now.
- Really?


Uh,how did,uh,Holly explain
her way out of that one?


Well,apparently,her dumb friend Marsha accidentally
used her phone to text her husband Billy.


Marsha and Billy.


No one sprained any muscles there.


And now we are better than ever.


Look,I know this sounds crazy,but I think
I might actually be falling for this girl.


- You're falling for Barney and Marshall.
- What?


They didn't believe that you
could wait the three days,


so Barney changed her number
in your phone to his work cell.


Holly is Barney and Marshall.


Wait. That whole time it was them?


So Holly wasn't in the bath?


Or sitting by her window,looking
up at the stars,thinking about me?


Or lounging in her old cheerleader
uniform reading architecture magazines?


Yeah. I don't think they
actually did those things.


They were just at the bar.


Right.


But,yeah,it was them.


- Unbelievab.
- I know.


So you might as well tell
them you're on to them.


Yeah. Or...


I text them something that will
really mess with their heads.


Oh,I gotcha. Okay. How about...


"I haven't told any of my friends
yet,but I only have three months to live?"


- Not bad.
- Yeah.


How about "I once killed a man with a
shovel,and those feelings are creeping up again"?


I-I liked that thing someone said
before about having three months to live.


How about "I never told anyone this,but
I slept with my best friend's mom"?


Oh,that is good,but I feel like we keep
coming back to that three months to live thing.


- Wait. I think I got it.
- Oh,yeah?


He texted back!


"I probably shouldn't tell you this.


I mean we barely know each other."


But what the hell,I'll just say it.


This is it,dude. Here
comes the "I love you."


- I sh Stan were here.
- Stan.


What?


I sometimes have gay
dreams about my best friend.


I sometimes have gay
dreams about my best friend.


Why in the world would Ted text a girl he barely
knows that he sometimes has gay dreams about me?


Slow your roll. You?


He's clearly talking about me.


Dude,it's me. I'm his best friend.


Okay,one: that has never been proven.


Two: If anyone were to have gay
dreams about one of us,it would be me.


I mean,look at me. Now look at you.


A still-in-the-closet 80-year-old
wouldn't be into that mess.


Here's the thing,Barney.
I'm snuggly. You're not.


Who wouldn't want to snuggle up next
to this business on a Sunday morning?


Wrapped in a comforter,and it's raining
outside,and there's muffins warming in the oven.


I'm cuddly,bitch. Deal with it.


I work out every day.


If there is one thing we know about
Ted,it's that he likes a nice body.


This body would rock his world.


Ted and I have a history.
I know what he likes.


There are things I could do to
him that would blow his mind...


Why do we keep trying
to have sex with Ted?


I don't know. It's weird.


Crazy,right?


Ted's having gay dreams about me.


And by me,he means
M-E,Marshall Eriksen,


star of Ted's gay dreams.


Who cares? So Ted has gay
dreams about one of you guys.


It's not like you found out
he has three months to live.


That's like,oh,shocking,right?


Hey,look at this guy.


How's it going,uh,best
friend of 12 years?


Well,it's kind of weird,but,uh,I
had this crazy dream the other night.


It's a little embarrassing.


You can tell us,Ted.
This is a safe space.


ah,your feelings are
perfectly natural,buddy.


Okay. Here's what happened. So I'm at...


And then I proceeded to waste a
half hour of those bastards' lives,


telling them about this dream I had


where I ate dinner with my top five
favorite architects throughout history.


And then,at the end of the meal,Frank
Gehry slides the check over to I.M.Pei,


and he says,Buddy,tonight,your
name is I.M.Paying.


Buckminster Fuller
almost did a spit take.


And then I woke up.


So,that-that's it?


No other dreams?


- Nothing confusing or erotic?
- Nope.


Okay,how about this?


Ted,you know how at some point in the
future,machines will rise up against us?


- Sure. -
Okay.So,the machines--


they've killed everybody,


and all that's left
is you,me,and Barney.


Which one of us would you,like...


get with?


And,um...


why do I have to get with one of you?


The machines are forcing you.


They want to watch. That's
just how they get down.


Oh,that's a... that's
a... That's a tough one.


I guess it would have to be...


Holly.


Robin told me what you guys did.


That's why I made up
the gay dreams thing.


Uh,guys,this is Holly.


And I didn't wait your
precious three days to call her.


I knew where she worked,so
I tracked her down.


Um,let me ask you. Did
I call you too soon?


I loved that he called me right away.


I found it very romantic.


And by the way,I don't sit around my
apartment reading architecture magazines


in my old cheerleader uniform.


I do that completely naked.


So,uh,Holly and I are
going out to dinner.


- I'll meet you out front.
- Okay.


I'm sorr bud. We-We were
just trying to help you.


And,also,it was really fun.


I don't need your help,okay?
I can take care of myself.


And,yeah,maybe...


maybe there are some girls who wouldn't
like it that I called them right away


or said things too soon,but guess what?


Those aren't the right girls for me.


Maybe the right girl is the one
who loves that I do those thin


because that's just who I am,and I'm not going
to change because of some stupid Three Days Rule.


Oh,and,um,Holly spells
her name with an "I."


So I had proven that the Three Days Rule was
wrong,and I was out to dinner with a pretty girl.


And until right now,I've never told anyone
the truth about what happened on that date.


That's so funny! I love indie music,too.


We should get married.


Just kidding. Or am I?


Just kidding again.


That's it. We're totally
going to Brazil together!


And I went to my doctor this morning,and he
said it is all cleared up,so I'm good to go.


I think I'm in love with you,Ted.


In the end,I didn't need to wait
three days,but Holly really,really did.


Like a lot of rules,there are times
to follow them and times to not.


But I will tell you this.


When I got your mother's
number,I called her right away.


- Stan!
- Hey,fellas.


- Stan,aren't you working?
- Took the night off.


- That's great! We can all hang out!
- Yeah.


Uh,I can't. Got a date.


- You ready,baby?
- Yup.


What the...


Wait,wait. Couldn't you guys just
stay here and do your date with us?


Yeah,it'll be fun! Look,I'm laughing!


It's fun here! You like magic?


Fellas,it-it's time
we said good-bye.


I mean,we shared a very special afternoon
together,and that's something I will always cherish.


I'll never forget you guys.


- Do you even know their mes?
- No idea. Is the tall one Ted?


No. That's Marshall.
He's married to Lily.


- Okay. You like chicken wings?
- Oh,yeah.



